## Notes on Using This Baseline

This baseline report provides a reference for comparing performance improvements or regressions in the Pulya framework. To use this report:
1. Run benchmarks using the same environment and workload as this baseline.
2. Compare mean time and OPS metrics to identify performance changes.
3. Pay attention to notes for each benchmark, which may include specific conditions or observations.

### How to Interpret Metrics
- **Mean Time**: Average time taken per operation (lower is better).
- **OPS (Operations per Second)**: Number of operations completed in one second (higher is better).

### Known Limitations
- This baseline was generated on a specific hardware configuration.
- Results may vary based on system load, Python version, and framework updates.
